// To see where to place your transport on the scale take a look at this (note:
// a proto with a Quality twice bigger is not twice slower or twice worst, it is
// just worst, like the place on a leaderboard):
// - TCP, 2^31, multiplexed stated continuous protocol (stream have fight for a
//   place in the underlying protocol)
// - QUIC, 2^30, async stated discontinuous protocol (stream doesn't have to
//   fight but there is time taken to open the connection and stream)
// - Circuit, router underlying connection quality + the number of hops * 8
//   (that consider that all router are equal but there is really no better than
//   pinging/monitoring to know that) + 2^16 (base circuit value).
//
// Its also not needed to follow that closely, thing can be added if a proto add
// some overhead :
// - WS tcp score + 50
// - WSS ws score + 150
//

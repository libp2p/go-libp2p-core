// Package introspect is EXPERIMENTAL. It is subject to heavy change, it it WILL
// change. For now, it is the simplest implementation to power the
// proof-of-concept of the libp2p introspection framework.
//
// Package introspect contains the abstract skeleton of the introspection system
// of go-libp2p. It holds the introspection data schema, and the primitives that
// allow subsystems to register data providers, and clients to fetch the current
// state of the system.

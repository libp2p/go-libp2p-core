// Package backoff provides facilities for working with interdependent backoff timers.
//
// This package is motivated by https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-swarm/issues/37.
//
// We would like to associate backoff logic to each component of a multiaddr.
// For instance, consider a typical multiaddr of the form IP/transport/protocol.
// The backoff associated with IP dictates whether any multiaddr
// using that IP can be dialed (regardless of transport and protocol).
// The backoff associated with IP and transport dictates whether
// any multiaddr using that IP and transport can be dialed (regardless of protocol).
// And so on.
//
// Furthermore, we stipulate that software components that utilize backoffs on multiaddrs
// should share the backoff timers in order to benefit from each other's learnings.
//
// To this end, this package provides the definition of a backoff timer (as the interface BackoffTimer),
// as well as an interface for a shared set of backoff timers, called SharedBackoffs.

	// The IP timer should be cleared whenever any successful connection to this IP is established.
